MNIST Digit Recognizer

Project Overview

This project focuses on developing a neural network to recognize handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. It's an ideal project for those starting in computer vision and machine learning, providing a practical experience in training, validating, and testing neural networks.

Features

Handwritten digit recognition using PyTorch.
Data preprocessing and visualization of MNIST dataset.
Implementation of a simple neural network model for classification.
Evaluation of model performance on validation data.
Installation

Prerequisites
Python 3.8 or above
PyTorch
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Setting Up
Create a Conda environment and install the required packages:

lua
Copy code
conda create --name mnist_env python=3.8
conda activate mnist_env
pip install torch pandas numpy matplotlib
Usage

To run the digit recognizer, navigate to the project directory and execute the main script:

Copy code
python mnist_main.py
Data

The project uses the MNIST dataset, which consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits. Each image is a 28x28 pixel grayscale representation of digits from 0 to 9.

Model Architecture

The implemented model is a simple neural network with fully connected layers. The network consists of two linear layers with ReLU activation, followed by a final linear layer for classification.
